# Decision log

Every design decision, with its context, the alternatives and its
consequences, numbered in the order taken. D1 to D8 were set out in the review
and are written in full in [Master_plan.md](Master_plan.md), section 4; they
are indexed here. From D9 on, decisions are written here when they are taken,
and the journal entry of the work refers to them by number
(see [journal/README.md](journal/README.md)).

## D9. One compiler at a time, enforced by the build system

- **Context.** In mid-2026 two all-core builds restarted the PC; whether memory
  or heat was the cause was never established. The rule "one compiler at a
  time" existed only in the assistant's memory (finding F20).
- **Decision.** A Ninja job pool in the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`
  (`MBD_COMPILE_JOBS`, default 1) limits every build, whatever Ninja would choose.
- **Alternatives.** Rely on `-j1` in instructions (fails silently when forgotten);
  allow six compilers, as memory alone would (16 GB, 1.6 GB per compiler, 4 GB
  spare), which ignores the unexplained restarts.
- **Consequences.** Slow builds, which made build time worth engineering (D10,
  D18). Raising the limit is the author's call; the README says how, with
  temperatures watched.
- **Record.** Journal: Phase 0. Commit `d811521`.

## D10. Precompiled headers rather than include surgery

- **Context.** The engine was header-only; each of the 44 test files parsed all
  of it (92 s per file).
- **Decision.** One precompiled header shared by every test executable. Every
  file still includes what it uses, and the Linux CI job builds without
  precompiled headers to keep that honest.
- **Alternatives.** Trim includes file by file (long, fragile, and the engine
  headers were the bulk); move to a compiled library first (D5, the larger
  change, done later in task 2.8).
- **Consequences.** A test file 92 s to 23 s, a full rebuild an hour to 21 min.
- **Record.** Journal: Phase 0. Commit `d811521`.

## D11. Invariant tests are the gate

- **Context.** Months of scenario tests had not caught F1 to F4; a
  finite-difference check found them in an afternoon (finding F21).
- **Decision.** Every joint, constraint and force passes tests that hold for
  any correct implementation, at random states: velocities and Jacobians
  against finite differences of positions, the dynamics algorithms against
  each other and against Lagrange's equations, conservation of energy and
  momentum. Nothing is built on an element before it passes (working rule 2).
  Every other tolerance comes from a hand calculation (working rule 3).
- **Alternatives.** Scenario tests with tuned thresholds, which record what the
  code does rather than what it should do.
- **Consequences.** The suite failed on the old code in exactly the places F1 to
  F4 predicted (315 of 845 assertions), and on nothing else.
- **Record.** Journal: Phase 1. Commit `d811521`.

## D12. Body-fixed velocities, quaternions, one normalisation per step

- **Context.** D2 chose quaternions; how to store them, which velocity to
  pair them with, and how an explicit integrator keeps them unit remained.
- **Decision.** Joint velocities are body-fixed, expressed in the child-side
  joint frame; quaternions are stored `(x, y, z, w)`, Eigen's order; RK4
  combines its stages' `q_dot` linearly and normalises once at the end of the
  step. `integrate` (the exponential map) is used where a configuration must
  stay on the manifold: semi-implicit Euler and the projection.
- **Alternatives.** Normalise or retract each stage (costs RK4 its order);
  world-frame velocities (the motion subspace would depend on the
  configuration).
- **Consequences.** Coordinates and velocities differ in size (`nq` against
  `nv`); every algorithm handles both.
- **Record.** Journal: the kinematics kernel. Commit `cbab561`; `docs/kernel.md`.

## D13. Every constraint built from five primitives on markers

- **Context.** The legacy constraints were separate classes, each with its own
  derivatives, which is where F3 and F4 lived.
- **Decision.** Five primitives on markers (frames fixed on bodies): point
  coincidence, dot-1, dot-2, distance, no-twist, each with an optional
  time-dependent target. Point on a line and on a plane, and every joint
  closure, are compositions. Jacobian rows are filled as wrenches carried up
  the tree, with no body Jacobian formed.
- **Alternatives.** One class per joint closure (more code to get right, each
  with its own second derivatives).
- **Consequences.** Five sets of derivatives to verify, after which every
  closure is right by construction; the tests check each closure allows
  exactly its joint's motions.
- **Record.** Journal: constraints. Commit `d33a128`.

## D14. Range-space solve with a pivoted factorisation

- **Context.** Vehicle models contain redundant constraints (planar loops
  closed in 3D, joints closed twice); the legacy solve could fail on them
  (task 1.6).
- **Decision.** Solve for the multipliers with `J M^-1 J^T` factorised as
  `L D L^T` with diagonal pivoting; pivots below 1e-10 of the largest are
  dropped and their multipliers set to zero; the rank is reported. Project q
  and v after each step by Gauss-Newton in the kinetic-energy metric, each step
  halved until the residual falls.
- **Alternatives.** An augmented (KKT) system with a general solver; coordinate
  partitioning (choosing independent coordinates, which change with
  configuration).
- **Consequences.** `J^T lambda` and the accelerations are unique even when
  lambda is not. `validate()` reports the rank the solver sees (D19).
- **Record.** Journal: constraints. Commit `d33a128`.

## D15. Prescribed motion as constraints; t as a parameter in kinematics

- **Context.** Bump sweeps used to edit a constraint's target between solves,
  and steering moved constraint anchors between steps (F10): neither enters
  the velocity and acceleration equations.
- **Decision.** A driven motion is a constraint whose target depends on t
  (`JointDriver`, time-dependent primitives), with its rates in `nu` and
  `gamma`. In kinematic analysis t is a parameter: a bump sweep solves
  `phi(q, t) = 0` for successive t.
- **Consequences.** The driver's multiplier is the force the drive needs. One
  formulation serves kinematic sweeps and driven dynamics (plan tasks 3.2, 3.6).
- **Record.** Journal: the simulator and the vehicles. Commit `24faade`.

## D16. Steering of linkage axles by a rack body

- **Context.** F10: the tie-rod inner points were moved by different amounts by
  editing constraints.
- **Decision.** A light rack body on a prismatic joint along the chassis's
  lateral axis carries the tie rods' inner points, driven to the commanded
  travel by a `JointDriver`; each wheel's toe follows from the geometry. The
  travel per radian of toe is calibrated per corner. Simple corners still
  steer their tyre directly.
- **Consequences.** One more body and one more equation per steered linkage
  axle; the steering rate enters the equations.
- **Record.** Journal: the simulator and the vehicles. Commit `24faade`.

## D17. Delete the legacy core

- **Context.** After task 2.4 the kernel agreed with the legacy algorithms to
  5e-13 on random trees; everything had been ported by task 2.7.
- **Decision.** Delete the legacy core and its tests, keeping their closed-form
  cases on the kernel, instead of keeping both engines.
- **Alternatives.** Keep the legacy path as a reference (two engines to
  maintain, and a reference already known to be wrong in places).
- **Consequences.** 176 legacy test cases went; their physics lives on in
  `test_kernel_joints_physics.cpp`. One behaviour changed (contradictory
  constraints) and its test was rewritten to the new, documented behaviour.
- **Record.** Journal: library and checks. Commit `860b264`.

## D18. A precompiled header for the library

- **Context.** Task 2.8 moved 17 headers' code into sources. The build log
  showed each library source file spent 10 to 46 s, nearly all parsing Eigen.
- **Decision.** The library has its own precompiled header with the standard
  library, Eigen, the core and the kernel, and without the force, vehicle and
  analysis headers, so editing one of those recompiles only its users. One
  option, `MBD_PCH`, covers the library and the tests.
- **Consequences.** Library files 0.4 to 3 s; a full rebuild 7.4 min at one job.
- **Record.** Journal: library and checks. Commit `32f2075`.

## D19. Checks in every build; `validate()` reports without throwing

- **Context.** Size checks were debug-only asserts (F16); in release a wrong
  size was read out of bounds. Malformed models failed later, far from the
  cause.
- **Decision.** Every kernel entry point checks its arguments in every build:
  one comparison each, the message built only on failure. Solver and simulator
  reject references to missing bodies when built. `validate()` collects every
  problem it can find into a report with errors, warnings and notes, and
  counts the degrees of freedom.
- **Alternatives.** Checks only in Debug (the release user gets corruption);
  `validate()` that throws on the first problem (the user fixes one at a time).
- **Consequences.** Each message names the function, body or constraint at
  fault; these messages are the start of the help catalogue (D23).
- **Record.** Journal: library and checks. Commit `253e788`.

## D20. One kinematics pass per evaluation

- **Context.** The sedan needed to step in under 250 us (task 2.10). Each
  evaluation ran the kinematics four times.
- **Decision.** `forward_kinematics(q, v, 0)` serves the forces, the constraint
  equations, the mass matrix (`mass_matrix`) and the bias forces
  (`bias_forces`, from `a_gf = a - [0; R^T g]`). The constraint matrix is
  `Z^T Z` with `Z = L^-1 J^T`. The projection after a step is weighted by the
  mass matrix of the step's last stage and reuses its last evaluation's `J`
  and `nu` for the velocities.
- **Consequences.** 181 to 124 us per step. Callbacks must not run the
  simulator's kinematics while an evaluation is in progress (documented).
- **Record.** Journal: performance. Commit `9472d8d`.

## D21. How timings are measured

- **Context.** On the hybrid i7-13700H the same unpinned benchmark varied by
  more than a factor of two, and pinned runs an hour apart by 2.2.
- **Decision.** Timings are taken pinned to a performance core at high priority;
  two versions are compared alternately in one session, the older one built
  separately from `git archive`.
- **Consequences.** Pinned runs agree within 1 %. Absolute numbers carry the
  date and machine state; targets are judged in the machine's normal state,
  and the slow state is reported.
- **Record.** Journal: performance; `docs/performance.md`.

## D22. A development record for the book

- **Context.** The author will write a long account of the project, a thesis
  or a book of hundreds of pages. Git keeps what changed and the plan which
  tasks are done; neither keeps the reasoning, the alternatives, the dead ends
  or how numbers were measured. Conversations hold that, but they are
  temporary and outside the repository.
- **Decision.** Keep a record in the repository, written as the work happens
  and committed with it: a journal (one entry per task or session, from a
  template, with a retrospective per phase), this decision log, the raw data
  behind every number, and the book's outline and bibliography, kept current.
  Earlier periods are reconstructed from git and the plan, and say so.
- **Alternatives.** Rely on commit messages and the plan (too terse for a book);
  keep conversation transcripts (unstructured, temporary, outside the
  repository); write the book now (premature: its structure depends on work
  not yet done).
- **Consequences.** Every task ends with a journal entry in the same commit
  (working rule 7). The author completes the entries on the period before the
  review, which only the author knows.
- **Record.** Journal: Phase 2 retrospective; `documentation/journal/README.md`.

## D23. Help documentation grown with each phase, with message codes

- **Context.** The author wants the help documentation every program has, to
  use and debug the program. The plan left all documentation to Phase 15, by
  which time hundreds of messages and options would exist undocumented.
- **Decision.** A documentation track (H in the plan) that runs alongside the
  phases: a help folder `docs/help/` (getting started, concepts, how-to guides,
  troubleshooting, reference); a stable code on every error and warning
  message (for instance `MBD-K012`), each explained in a catalogue, with a test
  that every code in the sources is documented; debugging aids in the program
  (a model description, a step trace); an API reference generated from the
  header comments; and a rule that each task updates the help it affects
  (working rule 8). Phase 15 then completes and polishes rather than starts.
- **Alternatives.** Write all documentation at the end (the plan before);
  only generate an API reference (explains functions, not problems).
- **Consequences.** Message codes are introduced before Phase 3 adds more
  messages, so all new code uses them from the start.
- **Record.** Journal: Phase 2 retrospective; `documentation/Master_plan.md`,
  documentation track H.

## D24. Force laws in their own coordinates, with their derivatives

- **Context.** Task 3.1 asks for a force library whose elements return their
  derivatives with respect to position and velocity, which statics (3.5),
  linearisation (3.7) and implicit integration (Phase 4) need. Two forms are
  possible: each element's derivatives in its own coordinates (a spring's
  length and its rate, a joint's coordinate and rate, a bushing's relative
  displacement and rotation), or each element's tangent stiffness and damping
  matrices in generalized coordinates, geometric terms included.
- **Decision.** Every element states its force law in its own coordinates and
  returns the force with its two derivatives (`law(x, x_dot)` returning the
  force, `d/dx` and `d/dx_dot`), tested against finite differences of the law.
  Generalized stiffness and damping are assembled by the kernel from these and
  the elements' kinematics when statics and linearisation need them, starting
  from finite differences of the generalized forces, which the element
  derivatives then replace term by term. Tabulated characteristics are
  monotone cubic (PCHIP) curves, so that a monotone table gives a monotone
  force with a continuous stiffness. Forces on a joint coordinate (spring,
  damper, friction, limit stop on a revolute or prismatic joint) are a kernel
  element of their own that adds to the generalized forces directly: they
  need the joint's coordinate, which the world-force interface does not see,
  and are exact for it.
- **Alternatives.** Tangent matrices per element now: correct and fastest in
  the end, but a large amount of derivation (geometric stiffness of every
  element) before any statics exists to use it. Natural cubic splines for
  tables: smooth, but they overshoot between points, so a monotone damper
  table could give a force of the wrong sign.
- **Consequences.** Element derivatives are verified independently of any
  assembly. Phase 4 decides whether the analytic tangent matrices are worth
  their cost.
- **Record.** Journal: the force library.
